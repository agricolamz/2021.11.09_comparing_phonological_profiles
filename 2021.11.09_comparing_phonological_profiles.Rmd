## How I decided to give this talk?

* During the talk in our Lab with Misha and Ezequiel

**Jeff Good:** How you came up with the idea of calculating phonological distances? Is it some established procedure?

**Me:** No, we thought that it is the most obvious step... \pause

* The second reason:

```{r list, echo = FALSE, cache=TRUE}

#  Materials for the analysis

##  Materials for the analysis

Materials for the analysis can be different:

* segment\footnote[frame]{Lets leave the phonology vs. phonetics debate aside.} inventory (and grammar, if you are lucky);
* dictionaries;
* parallel corpora;
* unparalleled corpora.

# Criticism by [@simpson99]

## Criticism by [@simpson99]

[@simpson99] attacks UPSID\footnote[frame]{UPSID stands for UCLA Phonological Segment Inventory Database \citep{maddieson87} which consists of the phonemic systems of a
representative sample of 451 (this number changes from publication to publication) of the world's languages in machine-readable form. Now UPSID can be accessed via PHOIBLE database \citep{phoible19}.}-like researches:

* phoneme masks allophones
    * Standard High German /ç/ stands for [ç], [x] and [χ];
    * "The allophone no longer represents the phoneme, it *replaces* it";
* phonological relations between segments is lost
    * comparing just vowel inventories it is impossible to get information about e. g. vowel harmony
